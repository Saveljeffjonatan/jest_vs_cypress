This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# Jest testing
npm run test
# Cypress testing
npm run cypress
```

## Learn More

This project is setup to showcase difference between jest and cypress setups. It will eventually simulate a real world application with data regarding speed, accuracy and other goodies.
